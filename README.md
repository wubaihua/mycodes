## Now including:

* gau_AIMD: An ab initio molecular dynamics program by using Gaussian 16 for H2O molecule.
* PIMD: A path integral molecular dynamics program for 1-dim system, including harmonic oscillator and quartic oscillator. BAOAB algorithm has been used for Langevin thermostat.
* gamma_rmsd: RMSD calcualtion of eCMM/eCMMad for different value of $\gamma$.
* DFTtest: A DFT integral scheme test program.
* DVR_Bohmian: Bohmian dynamic + DVR for harmonic oscillator (unfinished).
* PILD: Path integral Liouville dynamics for 1-dim system (unfinished).
